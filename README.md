# NOTE  
This repository has been created to upload my final semester research on  
**Hybrid Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Based Adaptive Routing in Hierarchical Software-Defined Networks**  
using **SARSA** and **Q-learning** in **OMNeT++**.  

The core **C++** files used in **OMNeT++** as part of this research are uploaded here to demonstrate my **proficiency in C++**,  
supporting the submission of the **C++ Proficiency Form** dated **01/04/2025**.  

For a detailed understanding of the project, research papers, and algorithms, refer to **report.pdf**.

## ABOUT OMNeT++  
OMNeT++ is a **network simulation IDE** that utilizes the **INET framework**, which is entirely written in **raw C++**.  
It is used for simulating network packets, connections, and overall network behavior.

## SIGNIFICANT WORK DONE  

- Implemented the complete **Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm** with **SARSA** and **Q-learning** from scratch in **C++**.  
- Developed **custom policy functions**, including **Îµ-greedy** and **softmax**, in **C++**.  
- Inherited and extended the **INET framework** code, which is entirely written in **C++**.  
- Designed and implemented **reward functions**, **custom QoS functions**, and **federated learning mechanisms with global training**â€”all in **C++**.
